# WK-AUI-Chat
Althought I had time only to do single angular2 tutorial, I've somehow managed to encapsulate most of module's ui features. 
Seems like mainuifunctionality is achieved, meaning selecting friends from list to chat with, and maintain chat windows. A lot depends now on our 'mighty' server logic to supply data and process conversations. 
Still, there may be possible flaws, that i wasn't able to catch, but they will be covered in right time - documentation is long, but it also takes a little bit of experience to notice things.
